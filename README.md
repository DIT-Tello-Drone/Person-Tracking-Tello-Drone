# Person-Tracking-Tello-Drone
Python script for using a Tello drone to track and follow a person. The Tello sends video to your computer, which detects key points of your body. It then sends motion commands, determined through basic PID control, back to the drone in order to keep you well in the frame.

**The code currently works but the PID definitely can be tuned better still. I am also working on adding more tracking behaviors.**
